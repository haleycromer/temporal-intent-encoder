# Temporal Intent Encoder
A deep learning system that models behavioral sequences using a neural
sequence encoder.

The model learns an internal representation of intent over time and
scores how consistent new actions are with historical behavior.

This repository contains:
- A dataset generator
- A PyTorch neural network
- A full training loop
- Inference logic

This is real deep learning, not heuristics.
